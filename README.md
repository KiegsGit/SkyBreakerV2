# SKYBREAKER: ORBITAL ARSENAL  (Minecraft 26.3 · Fabric · Java 25)

You do NOT need to install Java, Gradle or anything else. GitHub builds the mod for you, for free, online.

## Get the .jar (about 5 minutes)

1. Make a free account at https://github.com and sign in.
2. Click **+** (top right) -> **New repository**. Name it `skybreaker`. Choose Public or Private. Click **Create repository**.
3. Unzip `skybreaker-project.zip` on your PC. Open the unzipped folder.
4. On the new repo page click **uploading an existing file**. Select EVERYTHING inside the unzipped folder
   (including the `.github`, `gradle`, `src` folders and `gradlew`) and drag it into the browser.
   Wait until all files finish uploading, then click **Commit changes**.
   (If `.github` is hidden in your file explorer, turn on View -> Show -> Hidden items.)
5. Click the **Actions** tab. A run called "Build Skybreaker" starts by itself (first run: allow "I understand my workflows" if asked).
   If it doesn't start: Actions -> Build Skybreaker -> **Run workflow**.
6. Wait ~3-6 minutes for the green checkmark.
7. Download the jar, either way:
   - **Releases** (right sidebar of the repo main page) -> `latest` -> click **skybreaker-26.3.jar**  (direct .jar download), or
   - the run page -> **Artifacts** -> `skybreaker-26.3` (a zip containing the jar; unzip it).

If the run shows a RED X, open it, copy the red error text and send it to me - I will fix it.

## Install
1. In SKLauncher make/select a **Fabric 26.3** instance (Fabric Loader 0.20.1 or newer).
2. Put into its `mods` folder: `skybreaker-26.3.jar` AND **Fabric API 0.165.0+26.3** (https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
3. Launch.

## Use
Creative tab **Combat**, or `/give @s skybreaker:orbital_railgun` / `satellite_laser` / `meteor_barrage`.
Hold the item: a ring shows where you're aiming (up to 128 blocks). **Right-click** to fire. Survival recipes are included.

## Config
`config/skybreaker.json` (created on first launch). Set `"terrainDestruction": false` to disable all block damage.
Also: per-weapon cooldown, countdown, damage, explosion radius, max blocks per strike, max block hardness, block-entity protection, player damage, camera shake.
